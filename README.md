# Breast Nodule Segmentation - Undergraduate Thesis

This repository contains the MATLAB scripts and analyses developed as part of my undergraduate thesis in Biomedical Engineering at the Federal University of UberlÃ¢ndia (UFU). The thesis focuses on evaluating active contour segmentation methods and the influence of preprocessing techniques in mammographic image analysis.

## Repository Contents

- **Processing.m**: Implements the preprocessing techniques and segmentation methods. This includes Wiener filtering, wavelet denoising, CLAHE, and active contour segmentation using the Level-Set sparse field method.

- **Metrics.m**: Contains the functions for calculating and evaluating key metrics such as eccentricity, Hausdorff distance, and segmented area. This file is used to assess the performance of the segmentation results.
